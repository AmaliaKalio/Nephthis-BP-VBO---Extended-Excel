# Nephthis-BP-VBO---Extended-Excel
Adds functionality missing from the OOB Excel VBO. Due to how Blue Prism has coded instance handle management for this application, this should replace usage of the base VBO, as you cannot mix and match. All actions from the OOB VBO are included in this release. Documentation will only cover new actions which have been added ontop of it.
